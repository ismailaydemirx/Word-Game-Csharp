# Word Game Console App

This is a simple Word Game application that runs in the console. It presents the player with a shuffled word, and the player has to guess the original word. The application keeps track of the score, adding points for correct guesses and deducting points for incorrect guesses.

## Usage

1. When you launch the program, a shuffled word will be displayed.
2. Guess the original word and enter your guess.
3. The application will check if your guess is correct and update the score accordingly.
4. The current score will be displayed after each guess.
5. You can choose to play again or exit the game.

## Example

```
